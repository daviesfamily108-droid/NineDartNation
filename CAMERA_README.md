Camera pairing codes — guarantees and behavior

Goal: Make camera pairing codes stable and non-changing after a user clicks "Generate code" for calibration.

What I implemented

- Immediate in-memory reservation: when the server generates a 4-letter pairing code it is immediately reserved in an in-memory Set (`activeCamCodes`). This prevents the same process from issuing the same code twice during the TTL window.

- Redis-backed atomic reservation (if configured): if `REDIS_URL` is configured and the server can connect to Redis, the server attempts an atomic `SET NX PX` on a reservation key (`camReserve:<CODE>`) with a TTL equal to the camera session TTL (2 minutes by default). That reservation is atomic across processes and ensures two workers cannot hand out the same code concurrently.

- Persistent session storage: the camera session object is stored in `camSessions` (a `RedisMap`). When Redis is available this means the session is persisted centrally; when Redis is not configured the session is stored in-memory inside the running process.

- Removal on expiration/close: when a session expires or is explicitly deleted (client disconnects, or join indicates expiry) the reservation key and the in-memory set are cleaned up so the code can be reused after TTL.

Guarantees and caveats

- If Redis is configured (set `REDIS_URL`), the reservation is atomic and cross-worker: once you click "Generate code" the code is reserved and will not be reissued by any other worker until the TTL or deletion. This gives a strong guarantee that the code never changes for the user during its TTL.

- If Redis is NOT configured (in-memory fallback): the reservation is only kept in the worker process that handled the request. In a single-worker setup this behaves as desired (cannot be reissued). In a multi-worker (cluster) environment there is a small risk two different workers could independently generate the same code at the same time because the in-memory sets are not shared. This is why Redis is strongly recommended for production or multi-worker setups.

- The TTL is 2 minutes by default (controlled by `CAM_TTL_MS` in `server/server.js`). During that time the code remains reserved; after expiry it is removed and may be re-used.

- If the server process crashes after generating a code but before persisting the session, the in-memory reservation will be lost. Redis mitigates this risk by storing the reservation centrally.

Recommendations for full confidence

1) Configure Redis in your environment (set `REDIS_URL`). This gives atomic, cross-worker reservations and persistent session storage.
2) Use HTTPS and protect endpoints; configure `NDN_ADMIN_SECRET` for admin operations.
3) Consider increasing the TTL if users need more time to complete pairing.
4) For an extra level of safety, capture and surface the generated code to the user immediately and avoid re-generating while the UI shows the pending code (client-side UX guard).

## Marker-based calibration workflow (2025-10-29)

- Print the marker kit directly from the Calibrator (Marker Calibration Kit → Open printable sheet). Each marker is labelled TOP/RIGHT/BOTTOM/LEFT with the ArUco ID we expect.
- Tape the markers so the inner edge touches the outer double ring. Keep them flat and fully visible inside the camera frame.
- Capture a still frame and click **Detect Markers**. The calibrator locates all four IDs, computes the homography, and auto-locks if the RMS error ≤ 1.2 px.
- The detection flow uses `markerIdToMatrix` → `detectMarkersFromCanvas`, which pairs `MARKER_TARGETS` to canonical rim anchors: TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT.
- A marker status panel surfaces detection results, missing IDs, and the computed error. You can clear the status to reset the panel without losing your snapshot.
- Printable sheet generation happens client-side via `createMarkerDataUrl` (Calibrator) to avoid bundling extra static assets.

If you want, I can:
- Add a small admin UI in the Ops panel to list/inspect active camera sessions and force-expire a code.
- Implement a server-side fallback that, when Redis is unavailable and cluster mode detected, uses a small central master (or file-based lock) to reduce collision probability.

Tell me which follow-up you prefer and I'll implement it.
