    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <li>Usage information: logs, match activity, and connection metadata.</li>
      <li>Optional payment information via third-party providers (Stripe) — we do not store raw card data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may use cookies and similar technologies to enable essential features and analyze usage. You can control cookies via your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data for as long as necessary to provide the Service and to comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data, but no system is perfect. If a data breach occurs we will notify affected users as required by law.</p>
